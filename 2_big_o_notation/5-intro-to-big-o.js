// Big O Notation

// What's the idea here?

// - We're trying to determine what is the best solution, when in programming there are usually more than one solution.
//     - Basically the most efficient solution
// - So how do we determine which is the best solution?
//     - We do this with the Big O (a numeric representation) to determine the best solution

// Who Cares?
    // - Yes getting the problem solved is important, and sometimes efficiency might not matter
    // - But it's important in job interviews
    //     - It helps with vocabulary
    //     - Useful for discussing trade-offs bettween various solutions
    //     - When codes crashes, helps identify inefficient solutions
